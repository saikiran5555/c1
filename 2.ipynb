    "K-means clustering is a popular unsupervised machine learning algorithm used for partitioning a dataset into a set of K distinct, non-overlapping clusters. It's widely used for data segmentation, pattern recognition, and data compression. Here's how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "Initialization: First, you need to choose the number of clusters K. Then, randomly select K data points from the dataset as the initial centroids (centers of clusters). These centroids can be randomly chosen or selected strategically if you have some prior knowledge about the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assigning data points to clusters: For each data point in the dataset, calculate its distance from each centroid. Assign the data point to the cluster whose centroid is the closest. Typically, Euclidean distance is used for this calculation, but other distance metrics can also be employed depending on the nature of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Updating centroids: After assigning all data points to clusters, calculate the new centroids for each cluster by taking the mean of all data points assigned to that cluster. These new centroids represent the center of mass of the data points in each cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "Repeating steps 2 and 3: Repeat the assignment of data points to clusters based on the updated centroids and the recalculation of centroids until the centroids no longer change significantly or a maximum number of iterations is reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "Convergence: The algorithm converges when the centroids no longer change significantly between iterations, or when the maximum number of iterations is reached. At this point, the algorithm has found a set of clusters where the within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS), which measures the compactness of the clusters, is minimized.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finalizing clusters: Once the algorithm converges, the final set of clusters is obtained, with each data point belonging to one of the K clusters based on its proximity to the centroids."
