    "Scalability: K-means is computationally efficient and can handle large datasets with a relatively low computational cost, making it suitable for clustering large-scale data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Efficiency: The time complexity of K-means is linear with respect to the number of data points, making it one of the fastest clustering algorithms for moderate-sized datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpretability: The cluster centers obtained from K-means are easy to interpret, making it straightforward to understand the characteristics of each cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suitable for high-dimensional data: K-means can handle high-dimensional data efficiently, making it suitable for applications in various domains, including image processing and text mining.\n",
    "\n",
    "Limitations of K-means clustering:\n",
    "\n",
    "Requires pre-specification of the number of clusters: K-means requires the user to specify the number of clusters (K) in advance, which may not always be known or easy to determine. Choosing an inappropriate value of K can lead to suboptimal clustering results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sensitive to initialization: The final clustering result obtained from K-means can depend on the initial positions of the cluster centroids. Different initializations can lead to different clustering results, making the algorithm sensitive to initialization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assumes isotropic clusters: K-means assumes that clusters are isotropic (spherical) and of similar size, which may not always hold true for real-world datasets. It may struggle with clusters of non-convex shapes or varying densities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sensitive to outliers: K-means is sensitive to outliers, as a single outlier can significantly affect the position of cluster centroids and the resulting clustering solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "May converge to local optima: K-means is prone to converging to local optima, especially when the dataset has complex cluster structures or overlaps between clusters. Multiple runs with different initializations may be required to find the global optimum.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite its limitations, K-means clustering remains a popular choice for many clustering tasks due to its simplicity, efficiency, and effectiveness in a wide range of applications. However, it is essential to be aware of its limitations and consider alternative clustering techniques when dealing with datasets that do not meet the assumptions of K-means.\n",
